	The fun park
		
	Today, my fabulous camp group went to a (an)
	{adjective} amusement park. It was a
	fun park with lots of cool {plural_noun}
	and enjoyable play structures. When we got there, my
	kind counselor shouted loudly, "Everybody off the
	{noun}." We all pushed out in a terrible
	hurry. My counselor handed out yellow tickets, and
	we scurried in. I was so excited! I couldn't figure out
	what exciting thing to do first. I saw a scary roller
	coaster I really liked so, I {adverb} ran
	over to get in the long line that had about
	{number} people in it. When I finally
	got on the roller coaster I was {past_tense_verb}. In fact I was so nervous my two knees
	were knocking together. This was the 
	{est_adjective} ride I had ever been on! In about two
	minutes I heard the crank and grinding of the gears.
	Thatâ€™s when the ride began! When I got to the bottom,
	I was a little {past_tense_verb} but I
	was proud of myself. The rest of the day went
	{adverb}. It was a(n) {adjective} day at the fun park.
